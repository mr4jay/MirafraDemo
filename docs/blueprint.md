# **App Name**: HVAC Optimizer

## Core Features:

- Sensor Data Visualization (Timeseries Analytics and Data Preprocessing): Deliver real-time and historical visualization of timeseries data from IoT sensors (temperature, occupancy, energy usage) to enable monitoring, analysis, and decision-making, with robust data access and preprocessing pipelines.
- Algorithm Output Display (Control Algorithms and Python Proficiency): Present the control algorithmâ€™s decisions (heuristic, optimization, or AI/ML) and HVAC actions in a transparent, actionable format, implemented in Python with AWS integration.
- Dynamic Configuration Engine (Control Algorithms and Requirements Capture): A tool that enables automated HVAC optimization based on user preferences, using heuristic, optimization, or AI/ML algorithms, with requirements-driven configuration management.
- Performance Dashboard (Timeseries Analytics and AWS): Display key performance metrics (energy consumption, cost savings, comfort) and real-time sensor data using timeseries analytics and AWS services.
